### David Yu-Tung Hui / 許宇同

There are multiple ways to write my name.
In Latin script, my surname is "Hui" and my firstname is "David Yu-Tung."
In Traditional Chinese characters, my family name is "許" and my given name is "宇同."
Most people call me "David."

I am currently unemployed.
I used to be an AI researcher in deep reinforcement learning.
I wrote two works improving the optimization stability of off-policy gradient-based Q-learning algorithms.

1. **Stabilizing Q-Learning for Continuous Control**  
David Yu-Tung Hui  
MSc Thesis, University of Montreal, 2022  
I described two principles for stabilizing deep learning algorithms and applied the principles to deep reinforcement learning.
The principles were 1) maximum entropy for deriving loss functions and 2) the neural tangent kernel for deriving regularizers.
In RL, maximum entropy justified the SACLite Q-learning algorithm and the LayerNorm regularizer reduced its divergence, especially in high-dimensional continuous control.

3. **Double Gumbel Q-Learning**  
David Yu-Tung Hui, Aaron Courville, Pierre-Luc Bacon  
Spotlight at NeurIPS 2023  
We showed that deep Q-learning has two heteroscedastic Gumbel noise sources arising from the parameter inaccuracy of deep neural networks.
An algorithm accounting for these noise sources attained just under 2 times the aggregate asymptotic performance of the popular SAC baseline.
